String: is a class and it is immutable so it is final and all classes parent is object so extends with objects
class final String extends object implements  charsequence, serilizable, compareable{
in the string class there is many methods
//code
}

1.String is non-primitive data type
2.String is a class
3.String is final class
4.String extends object class
5.aslo string implements charsequence   serilizable and comparable are interface 
there are 3 ways to define a string a)String class b)String buffer c)String builder

String contsatnt pool
before 1.7v scp is in method area but method area is contant so it cannot extend there memory then is transfeer into heap area after 
1.6v and heap area extends there memory at runtime also

there is 
a>by literal String s1="hello";
by literal we create single objects in scp 

b)by new keyword
String str=new String("hello");
we create two objects first one is in heap area another one is in scp


Garbage collectorn does not work in a string constant pool or string literal pool because  if there is noone points to that object
then there is always jvm is there and to point that object

if someone is pointing to object garbage collector cannot clean that objectbut garbage collector works in heap area


why string is final?
because the security purpose and the if change the data then other string objects are changes.

why immutable?
we cannot change
